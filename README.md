#Introduction

In here we decided to develop a mobile app which supports to Keells supermarket
If we develop a mobile application, it is easier for the customer rather than used computer or laptop they can use a mobile phone in their hands.
In this mobile application, the customer can view products without purchasing. After that, they can add the product into the cart. Then they can pay after the product delivered to their homes
Due to the covid-19, the people usually involved with the online delivery system. Using this mobile application customer do not want to socialize themself to buy the product. It is not the only advantage for people but also the company can easily handle their customers in this pandemic period. So, this app most helpful for society as well as the company
